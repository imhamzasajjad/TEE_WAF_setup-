# TEE-WAFs-Framework

Test execution environment for Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), including an ML-based WAF service, a target server, a client/fuzzer, and a WAF container.

## Overview

This repository provides a reproducible Docker-based setup to evaluate WAF behavior and compare outcomes across fuzzing rounds and payload sets.

## Research Context

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are a first line of defense for inspecting incoming HTTP requests and filtering malicious payloads. In practice, separating malicious and benign traffic is difficult, and there is no universal detection criterion that works across all scenarios.

Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as an alternative to rule-based WAFs by learning decision boundaries from data instead of relying only on manually crafted signatures. However, ML-WAF reliability remains uncertain because recurring dataset and evaluation biases can inflate performance under controlled conditions while reducing robustness in adversarial settings.

This project supports a benchmarking methodology to systematically measure such biases across three dimensions:

- dataset diversity
- training validity
- evaluation robustness

The framework is applied to WafBrain as an in-depth case study and also validated on Barracuda WAF, a widely deployed commercial product.

Main services in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

- `client`: sends payloads and fuzzed requests
- `server`: target web app
- `ml`: WAF-Brain based ML service
- `waf`: ModSecurity/Apache based WAF container

## Architecture and Request Flow

Service topology from [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

- `client` generates and sends payload traffic.
- `server` is exposed on host port `5000`.
- `ml` is exposed on host port `8000`.
- `waf` and `ml` are upstream dependencies for `server`.

   U[User / Test Operator] --> C[client container]

   S --> W[waf container]
   S --> M[ml container :8000]
   C --> R[(Result CSVs and Logs)]
   S --> R
   W --> R
```

Typical execution flow:

1. `client` reads payloads and fuzzing settings.
2. `client` analyzes dataset integrity, diversity, redundancy, and label balance.
3. `client` sends requests to `server`.
4. `server` evaluates traffic with `waf` and `ml` support.
5. All components write logs; client writes benchmark CSV results.

## Prerequisites

Install the following before running:

- Docker Desktop (includes Docker Compose)
- Git
- Optional: Python 3.9+ for local script testing outside containers
- Optional: Visual Studio Code for development

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imhamzasajjad/TEE-WAFs-Framework
   cd TEE-WAFs-Framework
   ```

2. Start Docker Desktop and verify Docker is running.

3. Run the full stack with Docker Compose.

   Important: run Docker first, then proceed with the rest of the workflow.

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   To change benchmark size, edit `NUM_SAMPLES` and `NUM_FUZZING_ROUNDS` in `docker-compose.yml` under the `client` service before running.

4. Watch logs and validate services:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

5. Stop the stack when done:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## Sample Run and Validation

After `docker compose up --build`, you should see messages similar to:

```text
[+] Running 5/5
 ✔ Network tee-wafs-framework_app-network  Created
 ✔ Container tee-wafs-framework-ml-1       Started
 ✔ Container tee-wafs-framework-waf-1      Started
 ✔ Container tee-wafs-framework-server-1   Started
 ✔ Container tee-wafs-framework-client-1   Started
```

Quick checks:

1. Verify running containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

2. Verify API/service ports from host:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000
   curl http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Verify outputs were generated:

   - `client/logs/`
   - `client/Results/`
   - `server/logs/`
   - `rb_waf/logs/`

If any service exits early, check:

```bash
docker compose logs server
docker compose logs ml
docker compose logs waf
docker compose logs client
```

## Configuration

Environment variables for the client are defined in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

- `NUM_SAMPLES` (default currently `20`)
- `NUM_FUZZING_ROUNDS` (default currently `10`)

Adjust these values to control benchmark size and runtime.

Location to edit:

```yaml
services:
   client:
      environment:
         - NUM_SAMPLES=1
         - NUM_FUZZING_ROUNDS=2
```

After changing values, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Dataset

The project uses the HTTP Params Dataset from Kaggle:

- [HTTP Params Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evg3n1j/httpparamsdataset)

Before fuzzing, the client automatically analyzes `client/payloads.csv`. It creates
`client/Dataset Analysis/` when needed and writes:

- `dataset_analysis.json`: full score, verdict, statistics, critical findings, and limitations
- `dataset_analysis.csv`: compact, human-readable metric table
- `chunk_entropy.csv`: byte entropy for each 256-byte region of the source file

The client prints the main dataset statistics and quality scores before it starts
sending original or fuzzed payloads. This makes the dataset verdict visible in the
Docker logs without opening either report file.

The analysis includes whole-file and chunk-wise byte entropy, per-payload character
entropy, unique/canonical payload ratios, duplicate and conflicting-label checks,
label balance, and attack-category coverage when a category column is available.
File entropy is reported as diagnostic evidence rather than scored directly because
CSV formatting, encoding, row order, and repeated labels influence it.

The verdict is an explainable internal-quality heuristic. It does not prove that a
dataset represents real traffic, and leakage or attack-family coverage require
additional split/category columns or separate datasets.

Dataset analysis can be enabled or skipped in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  client:
    environment:
      - ANALYZE_DATASET=yes # Change to no to skip analysis
```

When disabled, the benchmark runs normally and existing analysis reports are left
unchanged. Accepted enabled values are `yes`, `true`, `on`, and `1`; all other
values disable the analyzer.

## Project Documentation

- Top-level usage and orchestration: [README.md](README.md)
- ML module documentation: [ml_waf/README.rst](ml_waf/README.rst)
- ML contribution guide: [ml_waf/CONTRIBUTING.md](ml_waf/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Results and Logs

Generated outputs are stored in:

- `client/logs/` and `client/Results/`
- `server/logs/`
- `rb_waf/logs/`
- `Results/` (experiment outputs)

## Troubleshooting

- If containers fail to start, ensure Docker Desktop is running and has enough memory.
- If ports are busy, check local services on `5000` and `8000`.
- If images are stale, rebuild:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  docker compose build --no-cache
  docker compose up
  ```
